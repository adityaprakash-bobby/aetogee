# What's the Purpose?

I am almost done with my undergraduate course in Comuter Engineering and have learned computers the hard way - from "Absolutely no idea" to "Yeah I know what God's thinking" (however, I am yet to know new things. Learner for life!). It has been a nice journey so far with a lots of interesting stuff that is happenning in this field. Exploring new stuff everyday.

Now coming to the purpose of compiling this is that I always get texts and calls regarding how to start off with programming with absolute no knowledge of computers (almost). Now I don't want them to go through a tougher path (since it takes time, though it's worth the time) and get into hang of computers in a easy and systematic way. Yes, you learn better when you explore on your own, but if the start is a little smooth, you eventually end up there. It is also very difficult to make each one understand the same thing, again and again. So a compiled list will be handy. And also no will get stuck in the middle of learning (which I personally don't like).

## Who is this for?

Literally everybody with a passion for learning (computers, obviously!). That's it.

## Contributing

I will be laying of the foundation resources for the repo. And yes, if you think you know about some cool resources, you are very welcome to send a PR (also raise a issue related issue for referencing it to the PR, for easy tracking and making it systematic & organised). Let's learn and let others learn with us. The Contributing Guidelines will be there soon!

## Future extension

Thats obvious that this needs to be presented as a website (a gh-page). So thinking of a jekyll generated site for now.
