# What's the Purpose?

I am almost done with my undergraduate course in Comuter Engineering and have learned computers the hard way - from "Absolutely no idea" to "Yeah I know what God's thinking" (however, you don't know anything completely yet. Learner for life! :laugh:). It has been a nice journey so far with a lot of interesting stuff that is 
happenning in this field. Exploring new thing everyday.

Now coming to the purpose of compiling this is I always get texts and calls regarding how to start off with programming with absolute no knowledge of computers (almost). Now I don't want them to go through a tougher path (since it takes time, but it's worth something) and get into hang of computers in a easy and systematic way. 
Yes, you learn better when you explore on your own, but if starting is a little smooth, you eventually end up there. It is also very difficult to make each one understand the same thing, again and again. 

## Contributing and where it is all going

Hence, this is for people of every age ("Age is just a number to learn something new", yeah you came across it many time). I will be laying of the foundation resources for the repo. And yes, if you think you know about some cool resources, you are very welcome to send a PR. Let's learn and let other's learn with us. The Conributing
 Guidelines will be there soon!
